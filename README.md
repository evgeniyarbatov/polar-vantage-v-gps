# Polar Vantage V Satellites

Polar Vantage V has [several options](https://support.polar.com/e_manuals/vantage-v2/polar-vantage-v2-user-manual-english/gps.htm) for positioning satellites:

- GPS + Glonass (default)
- GPS + Galileo
- GPS + QZSS

Which of these give better accuracy for my location?

## How it works

- Upload route and GPX files to PostGIS
- Calculate distance between GPX and route

## Use with your own routes

- Create GPX route of a segment you want to use for testing accuracy ([route.gpx](singapore/benjamin-sheares-bridge/route.gpx))
  - It is important that this is as precise as possible
- Go to Strava and correct elevation on the activity. Download resulting GPX ([elevation.gpx](singapore/benjamin-sheares-bridge/elevation.gpx))
  - This will serve as the ground truth for the elevation
- Set Polar watch satellites to Glonass / Galileo / QZSS and record runs with each
